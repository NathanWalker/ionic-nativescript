## Take it for a spin

Run this after cloning:

```
npm run clean
```

NOTE: If you get prompted about installing `webpack` you can choose 'y'. This may prompt when using npm 7+.

It will set things up.

Now build it and prepare:

```
npm run build:mobile
npx cap sync
```

You can now run on either iOS or Android:

```
npx cap open ios
// or...
npx cap open android
```

## Troubleshooting 

### Android

1. If you see a build/run issue related to 'node', for example like this:

```
> Task :capacitor-android:compileDebugLibraryResources
> Task :app:runSbg FAILED
Error executing Static Binding Generator: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "node": error=2, No such file or directory
```

This means Android Studio could not find node. Close and open Android Studio via Terminal as follows which will help:

```
open -a "Android Studio"
```

2. If you see an issue like this in the build log:

```
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "io.nstudio.ngconf2021.CustomActivity" on path: DexPathList
```

This usually means a good project clean is needed. Try doing a full 'Project Clean' in Android Studio and build/run. If you still see the issue, try running once more - usually related to a clean/build cycle with Android Studio.

### iOS

Picture-in-Picture mode works only on a real device. You can plug an iPhone in and launch on your phone from Xcode to experience the PIP mode.
